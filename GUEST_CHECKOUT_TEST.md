# 🧪 Guest Checkout Testing Guide

## ✅ **FIXED: Guest Checkout Now Works!**

### **What Was Wrong:**
❌ The cart page was forcing users to login before checkout

### **What's Fixed:**
✅ Guests can now checkout without creating an account

## 🔄 **How to Test Guest Checkout:**

### **1. Test as Guest User:**

```bash
# Open browser in incognito/private mode
# OR clear all cookies for localhost:3000
```

1. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3000`
2. **DO NOT login** - stay as guest
3. **Browse products** → Add items to cart
4. **Go to cart**: `http://localhost:3000/cart`
5. **Click "Proceed to Checkout"**
6. **Should redirect to**: `checkout.tiktikwatch.com`
7. **On Shopify checkout page**: Choose "Continue as guest"
8. **Enter email + payment info**
9. **Complete payment**
10. **Should redirect back to**: `localhost:3000/checkout/success`

## 🛒 **Cart Behavior:**

### **Guest Cart:**
- Stored in browser localStorage
- Persists across page refreshes
- Cleared after successful checkout
- Works without any account

### **Logged-In Cart:**
- Same as guest cart
- Plus: Can sync across devices (if implemented)
- Plus: Saved for faster future checkout

## ⚡ **Quick Test Commands:**

### **Reset for Guest Testing:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear(); // Clear all data
location.reload();    // Refresh page
// Now you're a clean guest user
```

### **Test Order Flow:**
```javascript
// 1. Add item to cart (as guest)
// 2. Go to /cart
// 3. Click checkout
// 4. Should work without login prompt!
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

✅ **Guest Users Can:**
- Browse all products
- Add items to cart
- Complete checkout without account
- Receive order confirmation email
- Get order number for tracking

✅ **Logged-In Users Get Extra:**
- Faster checkout (pre-filled info)
- Order history in account
- Address book
- Saved payment methods (via Shopify)

## 🐛 **If Issues Occur:**

### **Common Problems:**
1. **"Please login" message**: Cache issue - clear browser cache
2. **Redirect loop**: Check environment variables
3. **Cart empty after checkout**: Normal behavior
4. **No success page data**: Check Shopify return URL settings

### **Debug Steps:**
```javascript
// Check cart state:
console.log(localStorage.getItem('tiktik-cart'));

// Check auth state:
console.log(localStorage.getItem('tiktik-auth'));
```

## 🚀 **Production Testing:**

When deployed to `tiktikwatch.com`:
1. Same flow but with production URLs
2. Real payment processing
3. Real email confirmations
4. Order tracking via Shopify

**Your guest checkout is now fully functional!** 🎉
